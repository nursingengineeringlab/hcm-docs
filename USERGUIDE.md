### Using the dashboard

The dashboard displays sensor state in three categories:

* Watch List,
* Normal, and
* Inactive. 

For all devices that is in the Watch List and Normal states, the dashboard will
display the patient's name, and rotate live data of the patient's RRI-calculated
heart rate and body temperature.

Patients listed in the Watch List have at least one sensor that is out of the
normal range. Those patients may need immediate attention.

Patients listed in the Inactive section are offline. They do not have live data
being reported into the system, however you can still view their logged data.

and logged data.
